I am an electronic engineer passionate about programming, therefore I decided to start my career as a web developer, at the moment I work as a programming and robotics teacher but I am looking for the opportunity to work as a Frontend developer.

I consider myself someone who loves to learn, I love learning new things all the time, not just programming. I like to play musical instruments, do sports and learn about space. Working as a teacher has allowed me to have good soft skills, such as working in a team, being resilient and proactive.
